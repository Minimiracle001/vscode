    How to Make Fluffy Homemade Pancakes Every Time
Use fresh ingredients.<ol><li>Check your flour and baking powder to make sure they haven't expired or gone rancid.</li>
Don't over-stir. <li>When combining your wet and dry ingredients, stir only until you no longer see any dry spots of flour.</li> <li>Over-stirring will make pancakes tougher (since gluten develops in the flour) and less fluffy (which happens when leaveners release bubbles).</li>
<li>Let batter rest.</li> <li>Resting about 10 minutes allows the leaveners to continue to work their magic, creating and expanding into thousands of tiny pockets of carbon dioxide.</li> The fluffier the batter, the fluffier the pancakes.
Start with a hot surface. Allow your skillet or griddle to fully heat up before you add batter. 
Make a test pancake. This is your practice run to gauge and adjust the temperature and cook time. Peek frequently at the underside to <li>check if the pancake is browning at the right pace. 
Don't press the pancakes. It's tempting to press down on the pancakes with a spatula after flipping, but this will result in a dense, gummy pancake.</li></ol>
