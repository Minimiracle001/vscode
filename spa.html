    <br>Quite pasta-bly the most famous noodle in the world, spaghetti is made a bit differently in the Italian region of Abruzzo, just east of Rome. Just like standard spaghetti, the Abruzzese version is long and thin, made with durum wheat semolina and water, but instead of having a rounded shape, this spaghetti is uniquely square and goes by the name spaghetti alla chitarra. Cooked to al dente, Trader Joe’s Spaghetti alla Chitarra’s shape and toothsome texture are well-suited to the buttery, spicy notes of the Gochujang Paste-infused sauce in this recipe.
